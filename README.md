AImagination
Welcome to AImagination, a journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence where imagination meets technology!

Project Overview
AImagination is designed for beginners to dive into AI by building a simple yet insightful image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project aims to demystify AI by walking through the process from data preparation to model evaluation.

Goals
Learn to set up a machine learning environment.
Understand data preprocessing for image datasets.
Implement a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
Evaluate model performance and understand the results.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the neural network
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib: For data visualization

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/AImagination.git
cd AImagination
Set up a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project
Download the CIFAR-10 dataset (This can be done within the script or manually):
Make sure you have an internet connection for the first run if the dataset is downloaded automatically.
Run the main script:
bash
python main.py
